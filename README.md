# Temperature Kata

A coding kata that focuses on **encapsulation** and **simple design**.

___

## Thought Process: Designing a Type

Consider this code:

```
float temperature = 36.7f;
```

Any problems with this? Discuss with your peers.

Being roughly the average body temperature (in °C) we might assume that it represents a measurement on the Celsius scale, but we might be misled. Could it be Fahrenheit? Or wouldn't the most appropriate *technical* temperature scale be Kelvin?

Let's use a clearer name:

```
float temperatureInCelsius = -300.0f;
```

That's pretty cold. Any problems with this code?

Temperatures below roughly -273,15 °C are [physically impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero). Let's write some code that tells us whether a temperature is physically possible, since we don't control where the measurements come from:

```
public class TemperatureUtils {

    private static final float CELSIUS_TO_KELVIN_OFFSET = 273.15f;

    public static boolean isAboveAbsoluteZero(float temperatureInCelsius) {
        return toKelvin(temperatureInCelsius) >= 0.0f;
    }

    public static float toKelvin(float temperatureInCelsius) {
        return temperatureInCelsius + CELSIUS_TO_KELVIN_OFFSET;
    }
}
```

Now we can easily filter out impossible measurements, if needed. Any problems with this code?

If it's a simple program that only deals with temperatures, this might be simple enough. But now imagine a more complex domain where not only temperatures, but many more concepts, are represented as a primitive type with public static methods scattered around. At that point, the difference between Java and C becomes negligible.

What are legal/meaningful operations on a temperature? Addition? Multiplication?

Imagine you had an object that represents the *concept* of a certain temperature:

* It does not imply any specific representation (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
* It hides the internal representation and data type.
* It has a small *surface area*, allowing only meaningful operations and preventing misuse.
* *Conversions* are replaced with *representations*.
* It is easily extensible: [There are many more temperature scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_scales_of_temperature) (although much rarer in practice).

## Requirements

* Measurements in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin are supported (i.e. they might be provided by different (hypothetical) external APIs on those 3 scales).
* From the caller's perspective, there are **no conversions**, only representations of the same temperature on the 3 supported scales.
* Temperatures can be formatted on all 3 supported scales.
* Immutable: No getters and setters.

  <details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

  You might be tempted to name some read-only methods `get...()`. What's a better naming scheme in this context? Discuss! Remember: We are not *accessing internals*, but *requesting
  representations*.

  </details>

* Common temperatures (e.g. absolute zero) can be accessed exactly where they would be expected.<br>Note: You might be tempted to create a (static) class like `TemperatureConstants`. What would be a more idiomatic approach? How would you expect the standard library to do it?

  <details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

  We are looking for static factory methods in the `Temperature` type. Note: We should probably define them as constants, since they are immutable and can thus easily be reused, but that's an implementation detail. `PUBLICLY_EXPOSING_THE_CONSTANTS` breaks encapsulation.

  </details>

## Example Values

You can use these values to test your implementation. You can of course [look up the formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_scales_of_temperature), but **if you don't fear a challenge**, try remapping the scales yourself based on these example values.

<details>
<summary>I want to try it myself, but I need a hint.</summary>

Remap algorithm:<br>
1. Scale the value by the distance between known points on each scale.
2. Offset it by the distance between the 0-points of the scales.
